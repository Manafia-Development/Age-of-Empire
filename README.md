# Age-of-Empire
## Credits to Andrei1058


This is a pvp minigame inspired by the famous Age Of Empire game from 2000. The objective is to build a city by collecting resources and then attack the other empires.



#### How to set up
<p>For setting up a new arena set Setup-Mode to true and then restart the server.<br/>
Join it and set the waiting lobby with /s setLobby and after add a map using /s addMap <name>.<br/>
Now set the spawn point for each team using /s setSpawn <Blue/Red/Green/Yellow>, the forum (king) spawn for each team with the command /s setForum <Blue/Red/Green/Yellow>,<br/>
and then you have to set the plots where the players will add buildings. <br/>
For example, you can add a small plot using /s addSmallPlot <team> <1/2> where team can be "Blue" and 1,2 are the pos.<br/>
You have to set it like a worlguard selection but please don't forget the set both the pos. <br/>
After you added some small, medium, and large plots you must go on the middle of the map and set some plocations where will be spawned some sea lanterns known as "rare items" in the game wich will give resources and xp faster,<br/>
this blocks will be spawned when the pvp countdown will finish. Done so, you can type /s saveMap and then /s finishSetup.<br/>
I reccomand this plugin for adding join signs in the main lobby.</p>
